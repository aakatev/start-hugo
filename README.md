# Hugo Generator

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/53166d79-7094-47d7-8378-ce9e6a62f6af/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hugogen/deploys)

The project is heavily inspired by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).

I think Hugo is a great framework for building JamStack sites. However, it can be confusing when you just getting started. With Hugo Generator you can remove a burden of creating some initial boilerplate.

## Development

The project is build with React and NodeJS Lambda, and is deployed on Netlify. You will need Netlify CLI to run it locally.

## Contributing

All the contributions are welcomed. There is a lot of hackery on both client and api sides, so please be aware.
